    <h1>We are starting to practice Github</h1>
    <h2>Eloise's change should be here now too!</h2>
    <p>We can see these changes updated when commited to Github. This is a new and wonderful tool for me to practice pulling and pushing changes to the shared project</p>
    <p>I can see the changes locally when updated in my own vscode, but for Eloise to see any changes, I must commit and merge in Github.</p>
